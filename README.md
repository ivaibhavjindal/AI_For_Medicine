# AI For Medicine 
For example, given an
image of a chest X-ray, so unstructured image data, can you train a neural network to diagnose whether or not
a patient has pneumonia? Or given structure data such as the patient's
lab results, can you train a decision tree to estimate the risk
of heart attack? Working on these
concrete problems, you also see a lot of
the practical aspects of machine learning from how the deal with
imbalanced data sets, to how to work with missing data, to picking the right
evaluation metric.

In machine learning,
we often default to classification accuracy
as the metric. But for many applications, that's not the right metric. So how do you choose a
more appropriate one? Even if your current
work is not a medicine, I think you'll find the
application scenarios and the practice of these application scenarios really useful, and maybe it
will convince you to get more
interested in medicine.

AI for medicine is taking off all around the
world right now. So this is actually a
great time for you to jump in and try to
have a huge impact. Maybe you can be
the one to invent something that saves a
lot of patients lives.
## AI for Medical Diagnosis
It is about identifying disease. Diagnosis means, the
process of determining which disease or condition explains the person's symptoms, signs, and medical results.
## AI for Medical Prognosis
Predicting the future
health of the patients, which is called prognosis. You will learn how to work
with structured data. So let's say, you have a patient's lab values
and their demographics, and use those to predict
the risk of an event, such as their risk of death or their risk of a heart attack.
## AI for Medical Treatment
The process of medical care and also for
information extraction, getting information
out of medical texts. You will
learn how to use machine learning
models to be able to estimate what the effect of a particular treatment
would be on a patient. You'll also learn about
the application of AI to text for particular tasks like, question answering and for extracting labels from
radiology reports.
